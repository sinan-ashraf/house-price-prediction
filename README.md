# 🏠 House Price Prediction ML Pipeline

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates a clean, end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting house prices using the **Ames Housing dataset**. It covers everything from data loading and preprocessing to model building, tuning, evaluation, and predicting prices for new houses.
